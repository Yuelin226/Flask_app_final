0,0,False,"I chose the AccuWeather App after I found out that my “farmer” sister showed how well it deciphers the ever changing Rocky Mountain weather.  I like the feature that allows you to see about 120 minutes ahead if there’s snowfall coming and when there might be a chance to get out of the house and run an errand.  It’s been pretty precise too.  The sunrise/sunset and moon phases can also be found on the main screen.  The main screen is well designed and further investigation of the site is easy to navigate through.   It gives you a weekly forecast and if you choose to do so, you can get a 15 day forecast.  I haven’t found the longer range forecast to be as accurate though.  It might be unrealistic to give a 15 day forecast in our day and age.  Even with all our science and gadgets it seems too “far-out” for any prediction.  Short videos are available of weather related events.  If you DON’T pay the approximately $4 a month, you can’t skip the commercials.  They’re pretty short though - 15 seconds- which seems long when you’re waiting for the video.

1,1,False,"Whatever you do, do not use the future radar. The future radar is not accurate at all. It showed that a thunderstorm would disappear by the time it would hit my area. WRONG. The thunderstorm that is a 5 miles away from my area hits me and brings penny sized hail and flooding rain. Accuweather’s algorithm for using a future radar is terrible. After you get an hour into the future radar mode, it starts broadening out the rain and sometimes exaggerates what you will see. For example, sometimes it says a shower will later turn into a hailstorm but that never happens. Sometimes it will say a thunderstorm will weaken and turn into a shower, but instead it will intensify into a hailstorm. Do not rely on the future radar for anything. All of the other features are pretty accurate. I like how it shows the rain total for the day and the night (could be inaccurate when it comes to spotty thunderstorms). The app is good with only banner ads (at least there is no video ads). I have been using accuweather for 2 years now and I have been satisfied using it, but if you are looking for an accurate future radar I would look somewhere else. Minutecast is very accurate, and I was very impressed when I first saw how accurate it was. This app is one of the first to use a minute by minute system of forecasting and I am very thankful for finding this app on the App Store.

2,2,False,"There are tons of weather apps available. The devs description is accurate, but I will tell you my top Pros/Cons. PROS: ~ Love the radar. Gives you an option to view the past or future. ~ A slick “Minute by Minute” wheel that pinpoints precipitation for the next two hours. ~ A ton of features that don’t overwhelm you when launching the app. The basic stuff is clearly and nicely laid out and simple taps/swipes will get you to deeper details if desired. CONS: * The “location services” pin points my house right on the mark. But, the app declares the location is a nearby city instead of the one my house is in. * I have several weather apps that use location services plus my own house thermometer. AccuWeather many times states that it is 4-6 degrees cooler than all the others. * That’s it. Some may feel those are picky things, but it is enough to knock off a star IMHO. Overall, a great app. I was happy to pay the $4 to support the devs and also get rid of the ads. 😄

UPDATE: AccuWeather no longer offers a pay once to get rid of ads. It is now a monthly or yearly fee. Besides costing much more, “family sharing” means nothing now.

The UI is still pretty good, and the forecast are more often accurate than not, but you are bombarded with a full screen ad every time you change screens (from daily to hourly, or hourly to radar, or from the daily summary to the weekly summary).   All of them come equipped with a 5-10 second timer before you can skip, the “close” or skip buttons are always tucked in the corner, and the same color as the ad.  Don’t worry, If you’ve already been hit with three ads during your 3 minute browsing session, there are another three (probably the same ones you just saw) heading your way fast.  If you can find a way to work around the frustration of the ads, it’s a pretty good app.  If you want to do a quick peek of the weather without having to jump through hoops, or put energy into navigating, this is not for you.

12,12,False,Been following reviews for about a month now. 95% of them dislike the update and ask for Version 13 back. Developer replies have been canned and unhelpful. I don’t need to read for the 50th time about your “persistent” toolbar. Only thing persistent is how the app fails compared to Version 13. I’m seriously wondering about the trustworthiness of Accuweather company. In 2017 there were reports that Accuweather was selling customer current location data without permission to other companies. Has this practice stopped? I hear other comments about ad placement becoming a nuisance. Is this a ploy to drive subscriptions up? Will you be releasing an “update” that returns you to the nice Version 13 but you call it Accuweather Platinum or another term other than premium so all those premium users are stuck with the inferior Version 14 unless they pay every year for a subscription?

50,50,False,"I’m using app for quite a while and its best feature for me was hourly precipitation graphic. I used it to plan my outdoor activities as it provided visual information for the whole day. 
But with the new update , though it has some advantages like dark mode and more uptodate design, this graph completely disappeared and I’m stuck with list of all weather information per hour and have to scroll through it to get some idea of what comes. Even the apple weather app has it better. 
Also the icons in the new version lack visual simplicity that older version had.

I use this app all of the time unlike many apps that sit idly on my phone.  I like being able to scan down the hourly forecast and see whether it was cloudy or Sunny or rainy which is gone now.  It is convenient to add different areas to quickly call up the weather. I use this when vacationing and it helped plan activities around the weather conditions.  They fixed the error that used to show up every time you open the App.  This version is very stable and works great.  It would be nice if they made it so you could pick the background color scheme.

(I gave up the desktop computer for the extra room, a laptop never lives up to the hype, my mobile is all I use)
After several years of using the six apps, my go-to weather apps are, Accuweather, and WTFORECAST . Both have easy interface, one actually speaks to me, seemingly reading my attitude, and both are the most accurate. 
Living in the PNW, weather is a difficult thing to predict. The local weather is calculated with Seattle as the center of the universe. With the Straight of Jan De Fuca giving the Pacific Ocean a smooth highway, the I-5 corridor giving passage to the north/south movements, then the Puget Sound acting as a whisk, predictions are not easy. And, non of it applies to Bellingham, Washington. I get a more accurate weather report with Vancouver, BC is the target audience. 
Accuweather gives me that kind of information. 
So does WTFORECAST, only, they use stronger language. 
Thanks Accuweather!",2020-11-10 16:54:15,5

Such is the same data provided on TV newscasts of what the weather was.  That data helps us educate ourselves to correlate what we observed in our own environment and thereby better understand what your forecast more likely means to how our bodies will react and need to be cared for during the forecasted period.

Specs I only care about are the hourly and high/low for: temp, humidity, wind speed, real feel, rain inches.  If I could get a barometric pressure understanding tutorial from you to make that also meaningful, then I would want that too.

I recently started thinking about switching to a different app because AccuWeather no longer shows any forecast history for the recent past. AccuWeather used to let you go back in time a few hours to see the temperature, if it rained, and how much, as well as other useful information. 

Then I noticed the “premium +” eyesore pop up in the top right corner. Today, I was bombarded with ads upon opening the app. I am horribly disappointed in AccuWeather, and I’ve deleted the app for the first (and last) time. I will not be returning, you guys screwed up this time.

Apart from that, the interface is much less intuitive than the old one and seems to be designed for looks over utility. I will be finding a different weather app in the near future unless there’s another major overhaul of this one.",2020-07-31 17:56:47,1

All of my saved locations did not port over. You get the drift and I could go on and on but don’t want to bore you. I really am sad because the old app was probably my most used app. Will have to find an alternative. Any suggestions?,2020-08-19 23:55:49,1

It remains to seen if the speed and accuracy of precipitation and storm predictions will be as slow as temperature updates and whether the radar animation will be improved enough to be worth looking at. 

The fast and powerful two hour minute cast is what made prior versions unique and worth looking at. Oh, the new, languorous bright orange opening screen hurts my eyes.

2515,2515,False,"I’ve been using This app since it first became available. This was an unnecessary update which has ‘improved’ the app into a failure. 

How can it be that you can’t see vital weather stats like dew point, barometer and wind speed/direction at a glance?

I’ve been living with this update for over a week now and even with familiarity the user experience hasn’t improved. It may be time to give Accuweather the heave ho and find a new weather app. Lord knows, there’s plenty to choose from.",no bylines,2020-07-30 15:51:38,1,Horrible update,,US,1,"I’ve been using This app since it first became available.

2516,2516,False,New app update is terrible! It is raining cats and dogs and the weather app shows absolutely no rain. What good is this app if it is not accurate?

2518,2518,False,"The old app was 5 stars from me because it was so user friendly and had exactly what I needed. This new app is redundant, not intuitive, and doesn’t easily display the features I need. (For example, how do I now look at a weeklong forecast? Or even 15 days ahead like I used to?). I’m not terrible with technology, so if it’s not easy for me to figure out, I can’t imagine how it is for someone who does struggle.

2519,2519,False,At first glance I didn’t like the app right away as I found it was too difficult to get a quick video of my day and I didn’t like how the hourly layout appeared which is what I use the most. I am someone who embraces change so gave to some time to get adjusted. Still really don’t like the app. Sure there is a lot of information but there is no streamlined approach. I would have preferred a more sleek and simple interface.,Neonate #1,2020-07-23 10:00:40,1,New app interface TOO busy and much harder to quickly navigate,,US,1,At first glance I didn’t like the app right away as I found it was too difficult to get a quick video of my day and I didn’t like how the hourly layout appeared which is what I use the most.
